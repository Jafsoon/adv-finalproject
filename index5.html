                <h2>Crypto Trading</h2>
                <p>Crypto trading is different from investing directly in a cryptocurrency. For example, if you were to
                    invest money directly in a cryptocurrency, it would only be possible to make a profit if the sell
                    price were higher than the buy price. <a
